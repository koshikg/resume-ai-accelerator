# CODEOWNERS assigns code reviewers automatically based on file path patterns.
# Docs: https://docs.github.com/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners

# Repository-wide owner (all files):
* @koshikg

# Example of how to narrow in future (uncomment / edit as needed):
# docs/** @koshikg
# scripts/** @koshikg
# latex/** @koshikg

# Notes:
# - Place this file in the .github/ directory (current location) or at repo root.
# - To enforce reviews, enable "Require review from Code Owners" in branch protection for main.
# - Multiple owners can be space-separated; teams use @org/team-name syntax.
